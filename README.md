# Interactive Landing Page

A starter code was provided by Udacity with some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I added interactive features using JavaScript primarily.

To see it, open `index.html` with your favorite browser.

## Features
- Navigation is built dynamically
- Automatically setting active class to sections
- highlights menu when the section is active
- Smooth scrolling
- Back to top button
